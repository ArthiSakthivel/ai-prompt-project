## 🧩 How It Works

- JavaScript handles **page switching** using `.showPage()` function to display different sections.
- Products are displayed dynamically, and each "Add to Cart" button updates the cart sidebar.
- The **cart** persists state during navigation between pages.
- The **checkout form** collects user details and shows an order summary.
- Upon submission, a confirmation screen is displayed with order details.
